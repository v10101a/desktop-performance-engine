//  Imported from ~/segcam (2026-09-10), unchanged except for this header.
//
//  segcam's second display: every detection becomes its own titled macOS window holding
//  the frame it was cut from, positioned where it sat in the picture, so the desktop
//  piles up with everything the source has seen. Panels are recycled rather than closed
//  and recreated — at thirty frames a second of brand-new instances, churning real
//  windows that fast costs far more than re-dressing one that already exists.
//
//  Driven here by `SegSwarmController` instead of segcam's app. Fixes belong upstream
//  first; if this file and ~/segcam's copy drift, the one there is the original.
//
//  This copy used to carry two divergences — the window LEVEL and the green BORDER as
//  properties whose defaults were upstream's hard-coded look, so a cue could say what goes
//  over the pile and take the keyline off sixty windows that read as a debug overlay.
//  Both are upstream's own properties now (`SegmentSwarm.level`, `SegmentSwarm.border`,
//  with `SegmentPanel.defaultLevel` and `.defaultBorder` as the defaults), so the file is
//  the original again and `SegSwarmController` sets them the same way it always did.
//
//  ONE DIVERGENCE AGAIN (2026-09-12), to go upstream when ~/segcam is next to hand: a pool
//  of SPARE panels. `prewarm(count:)` builds panels ahead of time, hidden; `update` takes
//  one before creating one; `clear` hides the pile and keeps it as spares instead of
//  closing it; `SegmentPanel.blank()` drops a spare's picture. Everything else is as
//  imported. The first second of a pile used to be sixty real windows being created on
//  the main thread as the motion appeared, and on a cue that is a visible stall.
