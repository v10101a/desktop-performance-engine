//  Imported from ~/segcam (2026-09-03), unchanged except for this header.
//
//  segcam is a standalone macOS app: real-time webcam segmentation shown as green boxes
//  over the video, or as a desktop full of windows. This is its ENGINE — the part with no
//  opinion about where the pixels come from or what is done with the answer — carried in
//  whole so the two stay comparable. What was left behind: the Syphon input (a dependency
//  on a framework borrowed from TouchDesigner or OBS, and the thing the piece explicitly
//  does not want), the HUD and its slider, the keyboard handling, the device-cycling, the
//  desktop swarm, and the app scaffolding around all of it.
//
//  Fixes belong upstream first. If this file and ~/segcam's copy drift, the one there is
//  the original.
